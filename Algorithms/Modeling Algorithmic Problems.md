# Modeling Algoritmic Problems

The best way to understand an algorithmic problem is to identify the familiarity it has with othe resolved algorithmical problems.

## Permutations
The arrangements or ordering of items.

**Key Words** -> "Arrangement", "Tour", "Ordering", "Sequence"

## Subsets
The selection from a set of items. Order doesn't matter in subsets the way it does with permutations.

**Key Words** -> "Cluster", "Collection", "Committee", "Group", "Packaging", "Selection"

## Trees
These represent hierarchical relationship between items.

**Key Words** -> "Hierarchy", "Dominance Relationship", "Ancestor/Descendant Relationship", "Taxonomy"

## Graphs
Represent the relationship between arbitrary pairs of objects.

**Key Words** -> "Network", "Circuit", "Web", "Relationship"

## Points
Represent locations in some geometric space.

**Key Words** -> "Sites", "Positions", "Data Records", "Locations"

## Polygons
Represent the region in some geometric space.

**Key Words** -> "Shapes", "Regions", "Configurations", "Boundaries"

## Strings
Represent the sequence of characters or patters.

**Key Words** -> "Text", "Characters", "Pattern", "Label"
