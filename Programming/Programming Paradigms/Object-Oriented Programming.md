# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-oriented programming combines a group of variables (properties) and functions (methods) into a unit called an "object." These objects are organized into classes where individual objects can be grouped together. OOP can help you consider objects in a program's code and the different actions that could happen in relation to the objects.

## Basic features
### Abstraction
Refers to the process of exposing only the relevant and essential data to the users without showing unnecessary information.

### Polymorphism
Allows you to use an entity in multiple forms.

### Encapsulation
Prevents the data from unwanted access by binding of code and data in a single unit called object.

### Inheritance
Promotes the reusability of code and eliminates the use of redundant code. It is the property through which a child class obtains all the features defined in its parent class. When a class inherits the common properties of another class, the class inheriting the properties is called a derived class and the class that allows inheritance of its common properties is called a base class.

## SOLID
SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

### S: Single Resposibility Principle
A class should have just one responsibility.

### O: Open / Closed Principle
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### L: Liskov's Substitution Principle
Paren classes should be easily substituted with their child classes without blowing up the aaplication.

### I: Interface Segregation Principle
Many client specific interfaces are better than one general interface.

### D: Dependency Inversion Principle
Classes should depend on abstraction but not on concretion.
