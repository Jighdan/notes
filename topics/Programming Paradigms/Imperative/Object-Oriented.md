# Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data an code: data in the form of fields (often known an attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

A feature of objects is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify the data fields of itself. In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.

OOP is based on four concepts or pillars:
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

## Abstraction
Abstraction is to privatize parameters or methods in order to focus on _what_ the object does, instead of _how_ it is done.

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation means to bind together the data and functions that manipulate the data in a single unit, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.

## Inheritance
With Inheritance, we can define a general or common behavior, and have specialized classes or objects that inherit from such "general" class; in other words, it describes familiarity and hierarchy between classes or objects.

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism means that there can be many different implementation of an executable unit and the difference happen all behind the scene without the caller awareness.
