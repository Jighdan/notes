# Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. Common programming paradigms include: 

* Imperative: In which the programmer instructs the machine how to change it's state.
	- Procedural: Which groups instructions into procedures.
	- Object-Oriented: Which groups instructions together with the part of the state they operate on.
* Declarative: In which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it.
	- Functional: In which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications.
	- Logic: In which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules.
	- Mathematical: In which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem.
