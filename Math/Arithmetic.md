# Arithmetic

## Addition
The addition of numbers `n` and `m` is the combination or concatenation of a string of `|`'s. It is written as `n + m`.

### Laws
  - _Commutative_: `n + m = m + n`
  - _Associative_: `(k + n) + m = k + (m + n)`
  - _Successor_: `n + 1 = s(n)`
  
## Multiplication
The product of numbers `n` and `m` is the string formed by a copy of `m` for every `|` in `n`. This can be represented in many ways:
  - `n x m`
  - `n ⋅ m`
  - `nm`

### Laws
- _Commutative_: `n ⋅ m = m ⋅ n`
- _Associative_: `(k ⋅ n) ⋅ m = k ⋅ (n ⋅ m)`
- _Distributive_: `k ⋅ (n + m) = (k ⋅ n) + (k ⋅ m)`
- _Identity_: `n ⋅ 1 = n`
