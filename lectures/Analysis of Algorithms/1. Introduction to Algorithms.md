# What is an Algorithm?
Algorithms are the ideas behind computer programs.
An algorithmic problem is specified by describing the set of instances it must work on, and what desired properties the output must have.

### Example Problem: Sorting
> Input: A sequence of `n` numbers `a1`, `a2`... `an`.
> Output: The permutation (reordering) of the input sequence such as `a1 <= a2 ... <= an`.

## Correctness
For any algorithm, we must prove that it always return the desired output for all legal instances of the problems.

### Example Problem: Shortest Tour
An idea is to repreatedly connect the closest pair of points whose connection will not cause a cycle or a three-way branch, until all points are in one tour.
```
let `n` be the number of points in the set
d = Infinite
For i = 1 to n - 1 do
	For each pair of endpoints (x, y) of partial paths
		If dist(x, y) <= d then
			xm = x, ym = y, d = dist(x, y)
	Connect (xm, ym) by an edge
Connect the two endpoints by an edge
```
