    "## What is software testing?\n",
    "_Software testing_ is the practice of verifying that software behaves the way you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The anatomy of a functional test\n",
    "A _functional test_ makes sure that the software produces the right output for a given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic anatomy of a functional test:\n",
    "1. Prepare the inputs to the software.\n",
    "2. Identify the eexpected output of the software.\n",
    "3. Obtain the actual outpu of the software.\n",
    "4. Compare the actual and expected output to see if they match.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional testing approaches\n",
    "#### Manual testing\n",
    "_Manual testing_ is the practice of running your application, giving it some inputs, and checking wether it does what you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automated testing\n",
    "_Automated testing_ allows you to write a great number of tests that can then be executed as many times as you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Acceptance testing\n",
    "_Acceptance testing_ verifies the high-level requirements of a system; these are often carried out manually by a business stakeholder, but they can also be automated to a degree with _end-to-end testing_; this test makes sure that a set of actions can be carried out.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unit testing\n",
    "_Unit tests_ make sure all the little bits of your software are working, and they lay a strong foundation for a larger testing efforst like end-to-end testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Unit_: Small fundamental piece of software that can be executed in isolation by calling them with the appropiate inputs. Lines of code within those functions can't be isolated, so they're smaller than a unit. Classes contain many pieces that can be isolated further, so they're generally bigger than a unit, but they are occasionally treated as units.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integration testing\n",
    "Whereas unit tests are all about making sure individual pieces of your code work as expected, _integration testing_ focuses on making sure those units all work in tandem to produce the right behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [The testing pyramid](./assets/testing_pyramid.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regression testing\n",
    "_Regression testing_ is less an approach to testing per se, and more a process to follow as you develop your applications. A regression is a shift to an undesirable state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression testing is the practice of running your existing suite of tests after each code change before shipping your code to production. A _test suite_ is a collection of tests you've built up over time. Many development teams run these test suites in a _continuous integration_ (_CI_) environment, where changes to an application are frequently combined and tested before being released.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statements of fact\n",
    "The next step towards creating real tests is to _assert_ that a particular comparison holds true."

    "## Unit testing with unittest\n",
    "**unittest** is Python's built-in testing framework that can be also used for integration testing; providing features for making assertions about your code, and also the tool for _running_ the tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test organization with unittest\n",
    "Unittest provides a set of features for perfoming assertions. You previously saw how to write raw **assert** statements to test code, but unittest provides a **TestCase** class with custom assertion methods for more understandable testing output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running tests with unittest\n",
    "Unittest provides a test runner that you can use by typing **python -m unittest** in your terminal. When you run the unittest test runner, it will look for tests by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Looking in the current directory and any sub-directories for modules named **test_\\*** or **\\*_test**.\n",
    "2. Looking in those modules for classes that inherit from **unittest.TestCase**.\n",
    "3. Looking in those classes for methods that start with **test_**."
