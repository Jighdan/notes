    "_Abstraction_ defines the process of taking something concrete and stripping it of specifics.\n",

    "### Expectations of privacy in Python\n",

    "### Procedural programming\n",
    "Procedural software prefers to operate using _procedure calls_, which tend to call _functions_. These functions aren't encapsulated into classes, so they often rely on their inputs and occasionally on some global state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional programming\n",
    "Although functional programming realies heavily on functions as the form of abstraction; it requires you to think about programs as compositions of functions.\n",

    "### Declarative programming\n",
    "Focuses on declaring the parameters of a task without specifying how to accomplish it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- Abstraction is a tool for deferring obligatory comprehension of code.\n",
    "- Abstraction takes many forms: decomposition, encapsulation, programming tyle, and inheritance versus composition.\n",
    "- Each approach to abstraction is useful, but context and extent of use are important considerations.\n",
    "- Refactoring is an iterative process; abstraction that once worked may need to be revisited later."
