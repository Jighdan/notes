    "\n",
    "Binary search is an algorithm; it's input is a sorted list of elements. If an element you're looking for is in that list, binary search returns the position where it is located. Otherwise, binary search returns `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, for any list of `n`, binary search will take `log2 n` steps to run in the worst case, whereas a simple search will take `n` steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logarithms\n",
    "\n",
    "`log10 100` is like asking: \"How many 10s do we multiply together to get 100?\", the answer is `2`: `10 * 10`. Logs are the flip of exponentials.\n",

    "- Algorithm speed isn't measured in seconds, but in growth of the number of operations.\n",

    "- Instead, we talk about how quickly the run time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run time of algorithms is expressed in Big O notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `O(log n)` is faster than `O(n)`, but it gets a lot faster as the list of items your are searching grows."
